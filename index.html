                    <p>Built in the 2025 UC Berkeley AI Hackathon, Open Record is an AI assistant that helps journalists analyze public meeting recordings and transcripts more efficiently. Built with a full-stack RAG pipeline using Claude 3, Vertex AI embeddings, Supabase, and Groq Whisper, it enables <strong>transcript search, summarization, quote extraction, and multi-meeting trend analysis</strong> over real-world civic data. Instead of spending hours combing through lengthy city council recordings, journalists can upload audio files and instantly get key insights, direct quotes with timestamps, and automated summaries. The system tackles the growing bottleneck in local journalism where reporters struggle to keep up with the overwhelming volume of public information they need to monitor. By automating the most time-intensive parts of civic reporting, Open Record empowers journalists to uncover important stories and help communities hold their governments accountable.</p>
